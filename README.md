### Project Details
In this Weather App application construction, I developed using the APIs offered on OpenWeatherMap, 
when we log in to the application, we first encounter location permission transactions. 
When the permit processes are positive, we come to the home page first. 
Information from the location and weather details are shown to us. 
When we click the daily weather from the Bottom Bar menu options, 
the 4-day and 3-hour weather data of our location is available. 
There is a background feature that changes depending on the day and night situation in your location.
